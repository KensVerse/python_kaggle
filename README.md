# Kaggle Competition
My own notebooks and referenced notebooks for Kaggle competitions. The referenced notebooks are the best performing notebooks from each competition. Currently, 
this repo contains the following competitions:
* Classification:
    * Space Titanic
    * Titanic
* Regression:
    * American House Pricing
    * Store Sales Forecast 
<br>
The python script kaggle_commands_primary.py includes important code pieces from each competition lying within the referenced notebooks. In addition, 
kaggle_commands_complementary contains commands which are good to try, but not necessarily helpful in increasing the scores in some of the contests.
